# MLOps_task_Starting_Jenkins_Service_using_Docker_and_test_application
Here, in this project we are launching Jenkins services using Docker container. 
We had created a dockerfile for this and when we will launch a docker container using this dockerfile then the Jenkins service will be started automatically.
Also then we will write Jenkins jobs so that our Jenkins can test the application made by our developer on a docker container supporting that language.
Also we will keep track that whether our container is running properly or not. 
You will get all the steps required to follow in this process in the document "MLOps_task launching jenkins service from docker container and test application" in this repository.
